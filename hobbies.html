<h2>Here are my hobbies during my leisure time.</h2>

	<h4><li>Like to read book as well</li></h4>
	<p>In my opinion, for brief moments of time, books release us from the constraints of our own reality. They take us beyond our world and into someone elseâ€™s real or imaginary one. </p>

	<h4><p><li>Love watching movies</li></p></h4>
	<p>I'm into comedy, romance and drama these day. On watching a movie, we laugh, cry and are also filled with other emotions such us adventurousness or fear. Watching a movie provides us with an opportunity to express our emotions.</p>

	<h4><p><li>Love listening music</li></p></h4>
	<p>I love listening music intrumental especially piano. Music is such an important part of life. Throughout my life when I have been happy, sad, or wanting to just spend time on my own to get things done music has always been the answer. Music is all around us; while driving, eating at a restaurant, and anywhere. A life without music is not truly a full life at all.</p>
